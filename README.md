Hi! I'm Brian 

I had learn c# , java , asp.next , 89S51 , FPGA before

But now I'm more familier with Java 

Most of the projects you see here are written in Java

These projects are practice from Wasington University CS class

I'm using intelliJ writing my code 

If you want to see my project code , you need to open 「src」 then you will see my code

Hope you can learn litte bit more about my coding ability
